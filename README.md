# Transferable Adversarial Sample Purification by Expanding the Purification Space of Diffusion Models


## Acknowledge
Our work is based on the following theoretical works:
- [Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239.pdf)
- [Image-Super-Resolution-via-Iterative-Refinement](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.07636.pdf)

Furthermore, we are benefitting a lot from the following projects:
